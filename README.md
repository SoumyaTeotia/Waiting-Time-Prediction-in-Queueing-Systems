# Waiting Time Prediction in Queueing Systems
This project focuses on predicting waiting times in queues using machine learning techniques. By leveraging queuing theory and a neural network model implemented with scikit-learn, the study aims to estimate waiting times in bank queues. The dataset, sourced from Nigerian banks, provides insights into queue dynamics, customer arrival times, and waiting durations. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, the project achieves a mean absolute error of approximately 3.6 minutes, showcasing the efficacy of machine learning in optimizing queueing systems across various industries.

**Key Components:**
* Utilizes queuing theory and machine learning to predict waiting times in bank queues.
* Implements a neural network model with scikit-learn for predictive analysis.
* Utilizes a public dataset from Nigerian banks to analyze queue dynamics and customer behaviour.
* Emphasizes the importance of optimizing queueing systems for enhanced customer experience and operational efficiency.
* Demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning in estimating waiting times and its potential application across diverse industries.
